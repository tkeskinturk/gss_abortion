# Replication: Family Formation and Abortion Attitudes

This repository provides the replication files for the paper *Family Formation and Abortion Attitudes: An Analysis with the GSS Panels*, co-authored with Emilio Lopez Horner. It is a working (i.e., retired) paper.

The pre-print version of the paper is stored at [SocArXiv](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c2yvb/).

We used the General Social Survey panels from [Kieran Healy](https://kieranhealy.org/)'s [{{gssr}}](https://kjhealy.github.io/gssr/) package.

## Updates in the Replication Package

_2023, November_: In order to strengthen the future replicability of the study, I updated this folder by reorganizing the folder structure and adding {{renv}} configurations for package compatibility.
